        <p>Six pieces of evidence. Because faith in yourself is not a feeling. It is a case you build, one proof at a time.</p>

      <p><strong>&#x15A;raddh&#x101;</strong> means faith, trust, confidence. In the Bhagavad Gita, it is described as the essence of a person &mdash; &ldquo;a person is what their shraddha is.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>Self-efficacy &mdash; the psychological term for faith in yourself &mdash; is one of the strongest predictors of success, resilience, and well-being. It is not built by positive affirmations. It is built by evidence: remembering what you have already survived and accomplished.</p>
      <p>This experience helps you build that evidence file. Not with flattery. With facts.</p>
      <p>Everything stays on your device. Nothing is sent anywhere.</p>
