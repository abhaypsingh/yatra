           they endured is alive in you right now.</p>
        <p>This is the story of a chain. Each link is a generation. Each generation
           gave up something so the next could have something more.</p>

        <strong>Parampar&#x101;</strong> (Sanskrit: succession, lineage, unbroken chain) is the
        concept that knowledge, culture, and love are passed from generation to generation
        in an unbroken stream. In Indian tradition, you are not a solitary individual &mdash;
        you are a link in a chain that stretches back beyond memory.
      </p>
      <p>
        The generations described here are not one specific family. They are every family.
        Every person alive today stands at the top of a mountain of sacrifice they did not
        choose and cannot repay. The only thing they can do is add their own link.
      </p>

        What will yours be?
