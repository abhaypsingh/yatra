      <div class="opening-text">
        <p>Words are not equal. The same sentence can be a feather or a stone,
           depending on who says it, when, and what they are carrying.</p>
        <p><em>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine.&rdquo;</em> From a stranger, it means nothing.
           From your father after you cancel dinner, it is a door closing.</p>
        <p>You will see ordinary sentences placed in different lives.
           The words stay the same. Everything else changes.
           This is about learning to feel the weight before you speak &mdash;
           and after you listen.</p>
        <p class="opening-accent">Every word you say lands somewhere. Know where it lands before you let it go.</p>

      <p>
        <strong>Shabda</strong> (Sanskrit: word, sound, testimony) is one of the valid means
        of knowledge in Indian philosophy. Words are not mere sounds &mdash; they carry
        truth, intention, and consequence. In the Vedic tradition, the universe itself
        was spoken into being.
      </p>
      <p>
        This experience is about the invisible weight that sentences carry. The same
        words become different things in different mouths, at different moments, between
        different people. Learning to feel that weight is the beginning of speaking
        with care.
      </p>

        No words you read here are recorded or stored. They pass through, as all words do.
