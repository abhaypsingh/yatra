        <p>Life is heavy. You already know that.</p>
        <p>But the people who survive the heaviest things are not always the toughest. They are often the ones who can still <em>laugh</em>.</p>
        <p>Six strange questions. No right answers. Just the permission to be absurd, playful, and light &mdash; even when the world is not.</p>

      <p class="complete-mid">Humor is not the opposite of seriousness. The funniest people are often the ones who have felt the most pain. They learned that laughter does not erase the hurt &mdash; it gives you a break from it. A rest stop on a long road.</p>
      <p class="complete-closing">You are allowed to be deep <em>and</em> silly. Sad <em>and</em> funny. Broken <em>and</em> full of joy. Those are not contradictions. That is what it means to be fully alive.</p>

      <h2>Vinoda <span class="about-deva">&#2357;&#2367;&#2344;&#2379;&#2342;</span></h2>
      <p><strong>Vinoda</strong> means amusement, humor, playfulness, delight. In Sanskrit literature, vinoda is considered a vital rasa &mdash; an essential emotional flavor of a complete life.</p>
      <p>Laughter reduces cortisol (the stress hormone), increases endorphins, and activates the same reward centers as music and chocolate. Humor also improves creative problem-solving &mdash; when you are loose enough to be silly, you are loose enough to see new solutions.</p>
      <p>This experience exists because heaviness is not the only teacher. Lightness teaches too.</p>
      <p>Everything stays on your device. Nothing is sent anywhere.</p>
