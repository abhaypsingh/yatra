      <div class="opening-text">
        <p>In India, the place where two rivers meet is called a <em>sangam</em>.
           The waters do not fight. They do not ask which river is right.
           They simply flow into one.</p>
        <p>The hardest thing about growing up &mdash; especially when a family breaks apart &mdash;
           is learning that two opposite things can both be true at the same time.</p>
        <p>You can love someone and be angry at them. You can miss someone and not want to see them.
           You can need someone and push them away.</p>
        <p class="opening-accent">This is not confusion. This is being human. Let both rivers flow.</p>

      <p>
        <strong>Sangam</strong> (Sanskrit: confluence, meeting place) is the sacred point
        where two rivers merge into one. The most famous is the Triveni Sangam at Prayagraj,
        where the Ganga, Yamuna, and the invisible Sarasvati meet. Pilgrims travel there
        to witness the union of separate waters.
      </p>
      <p>
        This experience is about a different confluence &mdash; the place inside you where
        contradictory truths meet. Not to resolve them, but to let them coexist. Growth
        begins when you stop trying to choose between feelings that are both real.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are no wrong answers here. There are only rivers, flowing as they must.
