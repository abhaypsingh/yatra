      <h2>Shruti <span class="about-deva">&#2358;&#2381;&#2352;&#2369;&#2340;&#2367;</span></h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Shruti</strong> (Sanskrit: that which is heard) refers in the Vedic tradition to
        sacred knowledge received through deep listening &mdash; not learned, not invented, but
        <em>heard</em> by those who had cultivated the capacity to receive it.
      </p>
      <p>
        In human relationships, the deepest truths are rarely spoken directly. We say &ldquo;I'm fine&rdquo;
        when we're breaking. We say &ldquo;It doesn't matter&rdquo; when it matters more than anything.
        We say &ldquo;Leave me alone&rdquo; when what we mean is &ldquo;Please stay.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        This experience teaches the art of listening beneath the surface &mdash; to hear not just words,
        but the meaning they carry and the need they are trying to express.
      </p>
      <p>
        The people who are hardest to understand are usually the ones who need to be heard the most.
