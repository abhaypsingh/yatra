        <p>Hope is not optimism. Optimism says everything will be fine. Hope says: <em>I do not know if it will be fine, but I will keep going anyway.</em></p>
        <p>That is braver.</p>
        <p>Six dark rooms. In each one, a thread of light. Your job is not to make the room bright. Just find the thread.</p>

      <p class="complete-mid">Hope is not the belief that suffering will end. It is the decision that suffering is not all there is. That somewhere, in every dark room, there is a crack where the light gets in. And that <em>you</em> are the kind of person who looks for it.</p>
      <p class="complete-closing">That is not naive. That is the bravest thing a human being can do.</p>

      <h2>Uts&#x101;ha <span class="about-deva">&#2313;&#2340;&#2381;&#2360;&#2366;&#2361;</span></h2>
      <p><strong>Uts&#x101;ha</strong> means enthusiasm, vigor, hope, perseverance. In the Bhagavad G&#x12B;t&#x101;, it is listed as one of the divine qualities &mdash; the energy that keeps you moving when the path is unclear.</p>
      <p>Psychologist Charles Snyder defined hope as having three parts: a goal (something you want), pathways (ways to get there), and agency (the belief that you can take those paths). Hope is not passive wishing. It is active problem-solving combined with the refusal to give up.</p>
      <p>You do not need to see the whole staircase. Just the next step.</p>
      <p>Everything stays on your device. Nothing is sent anywhere.</p>
