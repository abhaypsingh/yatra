      <p>
        <strong>Smriti</strong> (Sanskrit: memory, remembrance) refers to knowledge carried forward
        through time &mdash; the wisdom that is remembered and passed from one generation to the next,
        from one version of yourself to the next.
      </p>
      <p>
        You are not the same person you were a year ago. You will not be the same person a year from now.
        Growth is invisible while it's happening. But if you leave a mark &mdash; a letter, a thought,
        a feeling &mdash; your future self can look back and see how far they've come.
      </p>
      <p>
        These letters are stored only on this device. They cannot be read by anyone else.
        They are sealed until the date you choose. They are yours alone &mdash; a conversation
        between who you are and who you will become.
