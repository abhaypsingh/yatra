        <p><em>They are the things that have not happened yet.</em></p>

      <p class="complete-mid">But here is what the waiting does not want you to know: <em>you are not paused.</em> Even in the limbo. Even in the in-between. You are growing, learning, becoming. The waiting is not wasted time. It is the time when the deepest roots grow.</p>
      <p class="complete-closing">Your life is not on the other side of the waiting. It is happening right now. In the middle of it. In spite of it.</p>

      <p><strong>Prat&#x12B;k&#x1E63;&#x101;</strong> means waiting, expectation, looking forward to. In Sanskrit, it carries a sense of directed attention &mdash; the mind oriented toward something that has not yet arrived.</p>
      <p>Psychology distinguishes between &ldquo;active waiting&rdquo; and &ldquo;passive waiting.&rdquo; Passive waiting puts your life on hold. Active waiting &mdash; the kind practiced here &mdash; means living fully in the present while holding space for what may come.</p>
      <p>Many of life&rsquo;s most important transformations happen not during the events themselves, but during the waiting that precedes them.</p>
      <p>Everything stays on your device. Nothing is sent anywhere.</p>
